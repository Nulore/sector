# Sector Null, "Deadzone"

Not much is known about the Deadzone as cosmic storms prevent all radio transmissions, light and Ampersand travel from entering.

The Cosmic Storms in the

Sector Null fails to be researched further with the only transmission being let out taking nearly 8 years to decode.

## [BEOWULF](../../factions/minor/beowulf)

In 4851 around December 12, a ship was detected exiting Deadzone space. This attracted the media, and caused a new research opportunity for multiple companies after proving the Deadzone was in fact able to be traversed, and giving some hope for those trapped inside.

One of the data recorded is a blackbox on a stolen Federation ship. An AI core has attempted it's best to describe the situation in text form.

- BEGIN BLACKBOX RECORDING -

The captain yells out, "FUCK!" As the ship begins to shake heavily and explosions are heard throughout the hull!
The monitors turn red, the glass cracks, the ship rattles as the abyss stares through the ship's eyes.
"Captain Matilda! Half of engineering has fallen to the abyss, what sector are we in!?" The Chief Engineer yells throughout the intercom.
"Hold Engineering still! Keep the oxygen sealed, how many resources do you have!?", Matilda yells out in response.
The intercom begins to broadcast static, but transmits one last message: "Not enough!" Before switching to static again.
"This is Captain Matilda of the Nest-IV, a stolen Federation ship." Constant explosions, gunfire and laser beams are heard throughout the recording, "We are currently in a zone of space controlled by [Pirates](pirates), anomalous entities and eldritch horrors."
You hear an eldritch screech, "If you do hear this recording, or find it at all. Please, broadcast the following message to the net."
You hear a massive explosion, as the recording cuts to black.
