# A Guide To Navigating The Quadrant (unknown author)

Welcome, new traveller, to the Quadrant. I assume you have found this book in a Federation spaceport, or perhaps you found it while stowing away on a ship, maybe you found it while serving at the Union? Doesn't matter, welcome to the Quadrant. The Quadrant is big and vast, with many alien species all over the place.

Now, I assume you're straight out of cryosleep for this reading. Welcome to the Quadrant! It appears you have been asleep for __`2062`__ years. Now, lets get you catched up on the latest. Around 2 centuries ago, Humans got into space and formed the Federation, but then humans discovered alien species and decided to keep them around, this caused a split in the Federation called the Human Union. Now, the Human Union wants to take over the Federation and kill or enslave all alien species, that's pretty bad personally but I'm not a fan of politics.

Now, let's talk about the Quadrant, AKA the Milky Way, AKA the galaxy, AKA whatever you wanna call it... The Quadrant is made out of Sectors, these Sectors all have seperate cultures and are controlled by seperate people. First, we have the singleletter Sectors, A-Z. After that, we have the double letter sectors, AA-ZZ. Unfortunately, we only go up to AV before we run out of sectors.

You may be asking, "oh author, how do we travel through these sectors? Travelling through stars already takes decades or even centuries on our fuel!" I hear you dear reader, now, allow me to introduce you to Ampersand. Ampersand is a scary place, but if you have the proper safety precautions you should be fine.

Precautions, hm? First, __CLOSE YOUR EYES__. Opening your eyes in Ampersand is VERY bad, and can cause to Ampersand Insanity.

Now, allow me to explain how Ampersand Drives work. Ampersand Drives have 3 main mechanisms, the container, the packager and the firer. The container basically holds Antimatter and Matter, usually Hydrogen. Then, it gets packaged into essentially a bomb, before the firer fires it. The package creates a temporary rift into Ampersand space before the drive collects the antimatter again for reusage.

Alrighty, now. Stay away from warzones and have fun!
