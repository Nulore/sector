# Ampersand Drives (&D)

*Not to be confused with the space [Ampersand](ampersand_space) or the sector [Ampersand](../sectors/ampersand)*

> "The &D rattles, and the sounds of Antimatter ejection causes loud shrieks and shockwaves into Ampersand space, before the bridge's windows are shut and the ship moves forward automatically, with what you can assume to be entering Ampersand space."

Ampersand Drives (to be short) create wormholes in and out of Ampersand space, using a bottle of fine [Antimatter](antimatter) and regular Matter, the Ampersand drive mixes these two together and vents it out allowing to tear the fabric of reality and into Ampersand space.
