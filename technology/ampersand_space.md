# Ampersand Space

*Not to be confused with the sector [Ampersand](../sectors/ampersand.md) or the drive [Ampersand](../technology/ampersand_drives.md)*

Ampersand Space is a tear in reality where you shouldn't be, moving through Ampersand Space is fast but not necessarily secure. There may be eldritch horrors or hungry gods seeing your ship.

Ampersand Space is not to be seen, which is why most ships with an [Ampersand Drive](../technology/ampersand_drives.md) bolt the airlocks down and close all windows to prevent seeing the outside. This is due to the multiple people suffering from Ampersand Insanity, in which you are seeing things no man should ever see.

There have been no recorded collisions of two ships travelling across Ampersand space, and some people theorize that Ampersand space is so torn apart that it is impossible to hit another ship. Communications are much faster in Ampersand Space allowing morse code in record time.
